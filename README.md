# Interactive Narrative Framework

## Project Overview

The **Interactive Narrative Framework** is a dynamic storytelling application developed as part of my second-year Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project at MIT. This application allows users to engage in an interactive narrative where their choices influence the direction and outcome of the story.

## Key Features

- **Branching Storylines:** Navigate through diverse scenarios and make decisions that shape your unique journey.
- **Timed Choices:** Certain decisions must be made within a set time limit to enhance engagement and challenge.
- **Modular Design:** Built with a modular architecture for easy updates and the addition of new storylines and features.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Informative feedback mechanisms to ensure a smooth user experience.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A modern and intuitive design accessible to users of all ages and backgrounds.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- JavaFX

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) and JavaFX installed.
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).
4. Run the `Main.java` file to start the application.

## Usage

Upon starting the application, users are presented with a narrative and options to choose from. Some choices will have a timer, adding an exciting element to the decision-making process. Explore the story and see how your choices affect the outcomes!
